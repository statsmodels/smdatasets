The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a
cross sectional survey conducted by the United States National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS).  It has been conducted every two years
since 1999, and sporadically prior to that date, starting in 1971.

The variables are numerically coded.  Code books are available from
the NHANES web site.  The variables are grouped by category.  There is
a separate code book for each category at each wave.

Here we provide a single merged file containing many of the variables
for the 2011-2012 NHANES survey.  File an issue if you need additional
variables or data for a different wave.
